# CryptoClustering

In this challenge, Python and unsupervised learning techniques were employed to predict whether cryptocurrencies are influenced by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

 ## Prepare the Data
-	Utilized the StandardScaler() module from scikit-learn to normalize the data extracted from the CSV file.
-	Constructed a DataFrame with the normalized data and designated the "coin_id" index from the original DataFrame as the index for the new DataFrame.
## Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame
I applied the elbow method to ascertain the optimal value for k, utilizing two distinct approaches for visualizing the best value: one involved creating a function, while the other entailed describing it step by step:
-	Generated a list with k values ranging from 1 to 11.
-	Initialized an empty list to store the inertia values.
-	Utilized a for loop to compute the inertia for each k value.
-	Created a dictionary with the data necessary to plot the elbow curve.
-	Plotted a line chart displaying the inertia values against the different values of k to visually identify the optimal k value.

## Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data
Implemented the following steps to cluster cryptocurrencies based on the optimal k value and original scaled data:
-	Initialized the K-means model with the optimal k value.
-	Fitted the K-means model using the original scaled DataFrame.
-	Utilized the model to predict clusters and group the cryptocurrencies.
-	Created a copy of the original data and appended a new column to store the predicted clusters.
-	Generated a scatter plot using hvPlot with the following specifications:
  1	x-axis set as "price_change_percentage_24h" and y-axis as "price_change_percentage_7d".
  2	Color-coded graph points based on the K-means labels.
  3	Included the "coin_id" column in the hover_cols parameter to identify each represented cryptocurrency.

## Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
-	Performed PCA on the original scaled DataFrame to reduce features to three principal components.
-	Extracted the explained variance to assess the information attributed to each principal component.
-	Constructed a new DataFrame with PCA data and designated the "coin_id" index from the original DataFrame as the index for the new DataFrame.

## Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
Applied the elbow method to identify the optimal k value for the model.

## Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
Utilized the following steps to cluster cryptocurrencies based on the optimal k value and PCA data:
-	Initialized the K-means model with the optimal k value.
-	Fitted the K-means model using the PCA data.
-	Predicted clusters to group the cryptocurrencies based on the PCA data.
-	Created a copy of the DataFrame with PCA data and appended a new column to store predicted clusters.
-	Generated a scatter plot using hvPlot with the following specifications:
  1	x-axis set as "PC1" and y-axis as "PC2".
  2	Color-coded graph points based on the K-means labels.
  3	Included the "coin_id" column in the hover_cols parameter to identify each represented cryptocurrency.

## Conclusion
The analysis indicates that the two methods employed to cluster cryptocurrencies yield similar results. The k-means model applied to predict clusters showed consistent outcomes in both datasets, whether the data were normalized or subjected to PCA. Nonetheless, in the PCA plot, the data points exhibit reduced spread compared to the original data, suggesting that PCA primarily influences data visualization in reduced dimensions rather than altering the inherent properties of the clusters.
